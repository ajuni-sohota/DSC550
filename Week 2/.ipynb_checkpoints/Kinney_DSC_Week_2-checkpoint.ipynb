Also be sure to run the example and read the Discussion from 6.9 Weighting Word Importance. Finally, consider tokenizing words or sentences (see 6.4) and tagging parts of speech (see 6.7) Be sure to review how to encode days of the week (see 7.6).\n",

I can get a decent grade on an SAT type test for math, but I don't really understand a lot of the mathematical ways to get the right answer. Lots of times you can figure out a \"common sense\" work around to a lot of the questions, but I would be ill prepared to take college level math courses despite the above average math score. \\n\\nThey're not just trying to bust the kids balls.</td>\n",

He hardly has he track record of someone trying to railroad workers for corporate interests so there must have been something he felt was hugely important to use so much political capital on something like TPP. \\n\\nMaybe TPP could have been better (it certainly seems so) yet maybe it was the best Obama could manage given the many and varied interests at play. However it does seem that it would have been in the US strategic interest and if we not only throw it out but begin a significant withdrawal from foreign markets that China will definitely move to fill the void. \\n\\nSo we may very well be looking at the end of Western economic hegemony with the election of Trump and the ascendency of other nationalistic movements in Britain, France and elsewhere. \\n\\nWhat's so sad is that it appears to be entirely self-inflicted. There is nothing forcing the retraction of the developed democracies, it seems to simply be the result of myopic reactions to globalism.</td>\n",

       "4  i am far from an expert on tpp and i would tend to agree that it had a lot of problems but my understanding was that obama was pushing it to create an economic bulwark against china in the pacific. \\n\\nhis administration recognized the increasing strength, maturity and bellicosity (see south china sea) and recognized that the us and it's allies had to push for increased penetration into the many emerging markets that would otherwise naturally tend to align with china. \\n\\ni always thought it curious that in the many critiques of tpp you hardly saw mention of why obama would be pushing for it. he hardly has he track record of someone trying to railroad workers for corporate interests so there must have been something he felt was hugely important to use so much political capital on something like tpp. \\n\\nmaybe tpp could have been better (it certainly seems so) yet maybe it was the best obama could manage given the many and varied interests at play. however it does seem that it would have been in the us strategic interest and if we not only throw it out but begin a significant withdrawal from foreign markets that china will definitely move to fill the void. \\n\\nso we may very well be looking at the end of western economic hegemony with the election of trump and the ascendency of other nationalistic movements in britain, france and elsewhere. \\n\\nwhat's so sad is that it appears to be entirely self-inflicted. there is nothing forcing the retraction of the developed democracies, it seems to simply be the result of myopic reactions to globalism.

       "      <td>i am far from an expert on tpp and i would tend to agree that it had a lot of problems but my understanding was that obama was pushing it to create an economic bulwark against china in the pacific \\n\\nhis administration recognized the increasing strength maturity and bellicosity see south china sea and recognized that the us and its allies had to push for increased penetration into the many emerging markets that would otherwise naturally tend to align with china \\n\\ni always thought it curious that in the many critiques of tpp you hardly saw mention of why obama would be pushing for it he hardly has he track record of someone trying to railroad workers for corporate interests so there must have been something he felt was hugely important to use so much political capital on something like tpp \\n\\nmaybe tpp could have been better it certainly seems so yet maybe it was the best obama could manage given the many and varied interests at play however it does seem that it would have been in the us strategic interest and if we not only throw it out but begin a significant withdrawal from foreign markets that china will definitely move to fill the void \\n\\nso we may very well be looking at the end of western economic hegemony with the election of trump and the ascendency of other nationalistic movements in britain france and elsewhere \\n\\nwhats so sad is that it appears to be entirely selfinflicted there is nothing forcing the retraction of the developed democracies it seems to simply be the result of myopic reactions to globalism</td>\n",

       "4  i am far from an expert on tpp and i would tend to agree that it had a lot of problems but my understanding was that obama was pushing it to create an economic bulwark against china in the pacific \\n\\nhis administration recognized the increasing strength maturity and bellicosity see south china sea and recognized that the us and its allies had to push for increased penetration into the many emerging markets that would otherwise naturally tend to align with china \\n\\ni always thought it curious that in the many critiques of tpp you hardly saw mention of why obama would be pushing for it he hardly has he track record of someone trying to railroad workers for corporate interests so there must have been something he felt was hugely important to use so much political capital on something like tpp \\n\\nmaybe tpp could have been better it certainly seems so yet maybe it was the best obama could manage given the many and varied interests at play however it does seem that it would have been in the us strategic interest and if we not only throw it out but begin a significant withdrawal from foreign markets that china will definitely move to fill the void \\n\\nso we may very well be looking at the end of western economic hegemony with the election of trump and the ascendency of other nationalistic movements in britain france and elsewhere \\n\\nwhats so sad is that it appears to be entirely selfinflicted there is nothing forcing the retraction of the developed democracies it seems to simply be the result of myopic reactions to globalism  "

As an example, while the dictionary data structure is ubiquitous in Python, most mainstream ML algorithms require matrices as input. Specifically in the realm of natural language processing, (NLP), it's imperative to \"remove the noise\"--stripping punctuation and stop words for example. \n",
